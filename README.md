## Manage HP DL380 G7 and Debian GNU/Linux 7.6 with Puppet/Git   

Having a few HP Servers to look after?

Then Puppet [1] configuration management and Git is really a nice pair.
Its also easy to finalize a new host deployment with Puppet.

Therefore, here are some Puppet manifests (recipes) for various applications
and services which I use on my HP server.

Description on the server setup itself can be found elsewhere.
